# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR UQUANTCHEM #
############################################

To install the uquantchem do the following:

(1) Select which version you want to install,
the serial, openmp or mpi-version 

(2) Depending on your choice in (1) to either:
    
cd SERIALVERSION/ 
or 
cd OPENMPVERSION/
or cd 
MPI_VERSION/

(3) Depending on the system specifications 
cp the "Makefile.compiler.version" to the
Makefile  (compiler = gfortran, ifort )
(version = serial,openmp,mpi)

(4) You need to edit the Makefile depending
on weather or not lapack and blas libraries
exist on your machine and weather or not the 
path to these libraries exist in your PATH
you need to edit the Makefile accordingly.

If you want to install the gfortran-stand-allone 
version of uquantchem, which assumes no preexisting 
lapack and blas libraries, perform the following 
changes to the Makefile:

Change the lines:

LAPACKPATH = /Users/petros/UQUANTCHEM/Src/V.21/lapack-3.4.0
BLASPATH = /Users/petros/UQUANTCHEM/Src/V.21/BLAS

to:

LAPACKPATH = /where-uquantchem-residesi-on-your-machine/V.35/lapack-3.4.0
BLASPATH = /where-uquantchem-resides-on-your-machine/V.35/BLAS

(5) Finally you are ready to compile, by doing the following:

	(a) For installation of gfortran-stand-allone version type:  make all

	(b) For installation with preexisting lapack and blas: make uquantchem


Best of whiches and good luck,
