A versatile and easy to use Quantum Chemistry Computational Software.
Version: V.28. The only difference between V.28 and the previous version,
V.27, is that a more effective storage of the electron repulsion integrals
(ij|kl) have been implemented in the MPI-flavour of the code. The openmp and
serial versions of the code have been unchanged and are identical to V.27.
